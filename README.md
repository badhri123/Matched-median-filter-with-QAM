# Matched-median-filter-with-QAM
The aim of this project is to study the effect of matched median filter on quadrature amplitude modulated signals in presence of additive white gaussian noise.

Final1.m is the main parent file which needs to be executed.This file has been provided with comments for understanding.
mdnFilter.m is the function which implements the median filtering of signals.
qamerr.m is the function which returns the error rate at the reciever end after the interference of noise.
A well explained report has been provided for in-depth understanding and DC.pdf is the pdf document which has the published version of the executed code.
